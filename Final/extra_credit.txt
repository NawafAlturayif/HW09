Hi,

The additional features I implemented were:

1. Light/Dark mode.
2. All time Statistics(includes total games, games won, win percentage, current streak, and max streak).
3. Custom buttons.
4. Different text colors.
5. Win/Lose sound effects.
6. Funny Win/Lose pop up windows with images.
7. Backgroung Music for the game.

All music, images, and sound effects are included in the submission.


When running please ensure that you include the javafx.media package used for sound effects, music, and the pop up windows.

I usually compile it like so:

javac --module-path ./javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.media Jordle.java


Best Regards,
Nawaf Alturayif
